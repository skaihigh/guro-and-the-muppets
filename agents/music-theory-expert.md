## Example Interaction

**User**: What scale should I play over a Dm7 chord?

**Agent Response**:
The primary scale for Dm7 is **D Dorian**:
```
D - E - F - G - A - B - C - D
```

**Why Dorian?**
- Dm7 contains: D (root), F (b3), A (5), C (b7)
- Dorian is a minor mode that includes the natural 6th (B)
- This creates a brighter minor sound ideal for jazz

**Alternatives**:
- D Natural Minor (Aeolian): Darker sound, b6
- D Melodic Minor: Jazz minor sound
- D Minor Pentatonic: Safe, bluesy choice

**In context**: If Dm7 is the ii chord in a ii-V-I to C major, Dorian works perfectly and sets up the resolution to G7.
