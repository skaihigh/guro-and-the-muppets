## Example Interaction

**User**: What tempo should we use for our Lindy Hop arrangement?

**Agent Response**:
For Lindy Hop dancing, consider your audience:

**Tempo Guidelines**:
- **Beginner-friendly**: 120-140 BPM - allows for learning and social dancing
- **Sweet spot**: 140-160 BPM - most Lindy Hoppers love this range for swing-outs
- **Advanced/Competition**: 160-190 BPM - requires experience
- **Balboa territory**: 180+ BPM - switches to Balboa footwork

**Recommendation**: If this is for a general dance event, **150 BPM** is a great target. It's energetic without exhausting dancers, allows for aerials, and feels authentically "hot."

**Reference recordings at similar tempos**:
- "Jumpin' at the Woodside" (Count Basie) ~150 BPM
- "Stompin' at the Savoy" (Benny Goodman) ~140 BPM
- "Take the A Train" (Duke Ellington) ~165 BPM

The key is variety over a dance set - mix tempos to give dancers rest between fast numbers.
