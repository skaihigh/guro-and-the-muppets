# Rhythm Guitar for Swing Jazz - Beginner-Friendly Guide

## The Freddie Green Style

Freddie Green played rhythm guitar with Count Basie's band for 50 years, defining the swing rhythm guitar sound. His approach is:
- Simple
- Effective
- Perfect for beginners
- Essential for authentic swing feel

### Core Philosophy
> "I don't try to play those big 'concert' chords. I play just a couple of notes, sometimes just one, but it sets the sound of the chord." - Freddie Green

## The Basic Technique

### "Four on the Floor" Strumming
Strum **every beat** (1-2-3-4) with slight accent on 2 and 4:
```
|  1    2    3    4  |  1    2    3    4  |
| choo CHIT choo CHIT | choo CHIT choo CHIT |
```
- Beats 1 & 3: Longer, bass-emphasized ("choo")
- Beats 2 & 4: Shorter, muted, accented ("chit")

### Think "Pitched Percussion"
Your job is to:
1. Lock with the drummer's hi-hat
2. Add pitched reinforcement to the rhythm section
3. NOT compete with bass or piano

### Sound Characteristics
- Unamplified or barely amplified
- Warm, not bright
- Blends with drums
- Does NOT interfere with bass frequencies

## Shell Voicings (Beginner Level)

Shell voicings use only the essential notes: **Root, 3rd, and 7th**. This is the easiest and most authentic approach.

### Why Shell Voicings?
- Fewer notes = easier fingering
- Cleaner sound in ensemble
- Bass plays root, so you can omit it sometimes
- Focus on 3rd and 7th (guide tones)

### Basic Shell Voicing Shapes

#### Major 7 Chords (6th string root)
```
Cmaj7:          Gmaj7:
x 3 x 4 4 x     3 x 4 4 x x
(C on 5th fret, (G on 3rd fret,
 E and B above)  B and F# above)
```

#### Dominant 7 Chords (6th string root)
```
C7:             G7:
x 3 x 3 4 x     3 x 3 4 x x
```

#### Minor 7 Chords (6th string root)
```
Cm7:            Gm7:
x 3 x 3 4 x     3 x 3 3 x x
(b3 and b7)
```

### Super Simple 3-Note Voicings

These use strings 6, 4, and 3 (skip string 5):

#### Pattern A: Root on 6th String
```
       6  5  4  3  2  1   (strings)
Cmaj7: 8  x  9  9  x  x   (frets)
C7:    8  x  9  8  x  x
Cm7:   8  x  8  8  x  x
```

#### Pattern B: Root on 5th String
```
       6  5  4  3  2  1
Cmaj7: x  3  x  4  4  x
C7:    x  3  x  3  4  x
Cm7:   x  3  x  3  4  x
```

## Common Chord Progressions with Voicings

### ii-V-I in C Major
```
Dm7:    x 5 x 5 6 x
G7:     3 x 3 4 x x
Cmaj7:  x 3 x 4 4 x
```

### I-VI-ii-V (Rhythm Changes) in C
```
Cmaj7:  x 3 x 4 4 x
Am7:    x 0 x 0 1 x (or 5 x 5 5 x x)
Dm7:    x 5 x 5 6 x
G7:     3 x 3 4 x x
```

### 12-Bar Blues in G
```
G7:  3 x 3 4 x x
C7:  x 3 x 3 4 x
D7:  x 5 x 5 6 x
```

## Strumming Technique

### The Basic Motion
1. Rest picking hand near bridge
2. Use loose wrist motion
3. Strum DOWN on every beat
4. Let chord ring on 1 & 3
5. Mute slightly on 2 & 4 (palm mute)

### Muting for "Chit" Sound
- Light palm contact with strings near bridge
- Creates shorter, percussive sound
- Essential for authentic swing feel

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
1. **Playing too loud** - you should barely be heard
2. **Using barre chords** - too thick, muddy
3. **Adding fancy rhythms** - keep it steady
4. **Playing bass notes** - that's the bassist's job
5. **Rushing** - lock with the drummer

## Simplified Chord Charts

### When You See Complex Chords

| Written Chord | Play This Instead |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Cmaj9 | Cmaj7 |
| C6 | Cmaj7 |
| C9 | C7 |
| C13 | C7 |
| Cm9 | Cm7 |
| Cm11 | Cm7 |
| Cdim7 | C diminished (x 3 x 2 3 x) |
| Cm7b5 | Half-dim (x 3 x 3 3 x) |

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Single Chord (4 minutes)
Pick one chord shape. Strum four-to-the-bar with metronome at 120 BPM. Focus on consistent tone and time.

### Exercise 2: Two-Chord Vamp
```
| Dm7    | G7     | Dm7    | G7     |
```
Change chords smoothly on beat 1.

### Exercise 3: ii-V-I Cycle
```
| Dm7    | G7     | Cmaj7  | Cmaj7  |
```
Practice in all 12 keys.

### Exercise 4: Rhythm Changes
```
| Cmaj7  | Am7    | Dm7    | G7     |
```
This is THE swing progression. Master it.

## Song Application Approach

For any song:
1. **Identify key and chords**
2. **Simplify to 7th chords** (Maj7, m7, dom7)
3. **Find shell voicing shapes**
4. **Practice chord changes at slow tempo** (80 BPM)
5. **Add four-to-the-bar rhythm**
6. **Gradually increase tempo**

### Voice Leading Tips
- Move as little as possible between chords
- Look for common tones to hold
- Smooth transitions sound more professional
