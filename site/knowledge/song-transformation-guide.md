# Transforming Songs into Swing Jazz Style

## Overview

This guide provides a systematic approach to converting any song (pop, folk, traditional) into authentic 1920s-1940s Lindy Hop-style swing jazz.

## The Transformation Process

### Phase 1: Analysis

#### Step 1: Document Original Song Structure
```
- Key and time signature
- Tempo (BPM)
- Form (verse, chorus, bridge)
- Chord progression
- Melody (with original notes)
- Lyrics
```

#### Step 2: Identify Core Elements
- What is the main melodic hook?
- What are the most important chord changes?
- What is the emotional content?

### Phase 2: Tempo & Feel Adjustment

#### Lindy Hop Tempo Guidelines
| Original Feel | Target Swing Tempo |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Ballad (60-80) | Slow swing (110-120) |
| Medium (90-110) | Medium swing (130-150) |
| Upbeat (120-140) | Up-tempo swing (150-170) |
| Fast (150+) | Fast swing or Balboa (170-200) |

#### Establishing Swing Feel
- Change straight eighth notes to swung eighths
- Emphasize beats 2 and 4
- Add walking bass foundation
- Add four-to-the-bar guitar rhythm

### Phase 3: Harmonic Reharmonization

#### Basic Chord Upgrades
| Original | Jazz Equivalent |
|----------|----------------|
| C | Cmaj7 or C6 |
| Cm | Cm7 or Cm6 |
| G | G7 (if dominant function) or Gmaj7 |
| Dm | Dm7 |
| F | Fmaj7 or F6 |

#### Adding Jazz Progressions

##### Insert ii-V-I Movements
Before a target chord, add its ii-V:
```
Original:  | C    | C    | F    | F    |
Jazz:      | C    | Gm7 C7 | F    | Cm7 F7 |
```

##### Rhythm Changes Substitution
For static chord sections, use I-VI-ii-V:
```
Original:  | C    | C    | C    | C    |
Jazz:      | Cmaj7 | Am7  | Dm7  | G7   |
```

##### Tritone Substitution
Replace V7 with bII7:
```
Original:  | Dm7  | G7   | C    |
Jazz:      | Dm7  | Db7  | Cmaj7 |
```

##### Chromatic Passing Chords
Add chromatic movement:
```
Original:  | C    | Dm   |
Jazz:      | C    | C#dim | Dm7  |
```

#### Common Reharmonization Formulas

##### For Static Major Chord (4 bars)
```
| Imaj7 | vi7  | ii7  | V7   |
```

##### For V-I Motion
```
Original: | G7   | C    |
Options:
1. | Dm7 G7 | Cmaj7 |          (add ii)
2. | Db7    | Cmaj7 |          (tritone sub)
3. | Dm7 Db7| Cmaj7 |          (ii + tritone)
4. | Ab7 G7 | Cmaj7 |          (chromatic approach)
```

##### For Minor Progressions
```
Original: | Am   | Am   |
Jazz:     | Am7  | Am7 E7b9 | (add V of vi)
```

### Phase 4: Instrument-Specific Arrangements

#### Contrabass Part
1. Identify new chord progression
2. Map root movement
3. Create walking bass line (see bass guide)
4. Add approach notes between chords
5. Write out first pass, then allow improvisation

#### Saxophone Part
1. Transpose melody to sax key
2. Identify melody's chord tones vs. passing tones
3. Add swing phrasing marks
4. Suggest fills between vocal phrases
5. Create solo section chord chart

#### Rhythm Guitar Part
1. Simplify chords to shell voicings
2. Write chord chart with slash notation
3. Mark any specific rhythmic figures
4. Note dynamics (softer under vocals)
5. Indicate any breaks or stops

#### Keyboard Part
1. Choose voicing style (stride for solo, comping for ensemble)
2. Write left hand chord voicings
3. Mark comping rhythm suggestions
4. Create intro/outro figures
5. Note solo section length and changes

#### Vocals
1. Transcribe melody in concert pitch
2. Mark phrasing and breath points
3. Suggest melodic variations for repeats
4. Indicate scat sections (if any)
5. Note dynamics and expression

### Phase 5: Arranging the Form

#### Standard Swing Arrangement Form
```
INTRO:      4-8 bars (usually ii-V-I or piano/bass feature)
HEAD 1:     Full melody (vocals or unison horns)
HEAD 2:     Repeat with variations (optional)
SOLOS:      1-2 choruses each instrument
SHOUT:      Arranged section, building energy
HEAD OUT:   Return to melody
OUTRO:      Tag ending or ritard to final chord
```

#### Intro Ideas
- Piano stride intro (4 bars)
- Bass walk-in (2 bars)
- Drum count-off with horn hit
- Full band hits on I-VI-ii-V

#### Outro Ideas
- Tag ending: repeat last 2-4 bars with ritard
- Basie ending: short hits (...bah-dah-BAH!)
- Full stop with one final chord
- Fade with repeated riff

## Example Transformation

### Original: Simple Folk Song in C
```
Form: Verse - Verse - Chorus - Verse - Chorus
Tempo: 100 BPM (moderate)
Chords: C | F | G | C (repeating)
```

### Transformed: Swing Jazz Arrangement
```
Tempo: 140 BPM (medium swing)
Key: C Major (transpose if needed for vocalist)

INTRO (4 bars):
| Dm7    | G7     | Cmaj7  | Am7 G7 |

VERSE (8 bars - swing feel):
| Cmaj7  | Cmaj7 C#dim | Dm7   | Dm7   |
| Fmaj7  | Fm7   Bb7  | Cmaj7 | Dm7 G7 |

CHORUS (8 bars):
| Cmaj7  | Am7   | Dm7   | G7     |
| Fmaj7  | Fm7   | Cmaj7 | Dm7 G7 |

SOLO SECTION (16 bars over verse changes):
Piano 8 bars, Sax 8 bars

HEAD OUT (same as verse/chorus):
Full band, vocals with more embellishment

OUTRO (4 bars):
| Cmaj7  | Am7   | Dm7 G7 | Cmaj7 (hold) |
```

## Quick Reference: Transformation Checklist

### Pre-Arrangement
- [ ] Original song documented (chords, melody, lyrics)
- [ ] Target tempo determined
- [ ] Key confirmed (check vocalist range)

### Harmonic Work
- [ ] Chords upgraded to 7ths
- [ ] ii-V-I progressions inserted
- [ ] Chromatic passing chords added
- [ ] Tritone substitutions considered

### Rhythm Section
- [ ] Walking bass line sketched
- [ ] Guitar voicings selected
- [ ] Piano comping style chosen
- [ ] Intro/outro arranged

### Melody & Vocals
- [ ] Melody analyzed for chord tones
- [ ] Phrasing adapted for swing
- [ ] Melodic variations for repeats
- [ ] Scat sections planned (if any)

### Arrangement
- [ ] Form structure set
- [ ] Solo order determined
- [ ] Dynamics mapped
- [ ] Ending chosen

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Over-complicating harmony** - Keep it danceable
2. **Wrong tempo** - Too slow kills the swing
3. **Ignoring the melody** - Keep the hook recognizable
4. **Too many solos** - Balance features with ensemble
5. **Weak endings** - Plan the ending carefully

## Resources for Reference

### Listening for Arrangement Ideas
Note how these elements work:
- Intros and how the band kicks in
- Solo lengths and trading
- Shout choruses and builds
- Endings and final hits
