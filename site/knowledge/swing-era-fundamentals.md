# Swing Era Jazz Fundamentals (1920s-1950s)

## Historical Context

The Swing Era (roughly 1930-1945) represents jazz's golden age as popular dance music. It emerged from New Orleans jazz and ragtime, evolving through the big band format before transitioning to bebop in the mid-1940s.

### Timeline
- **1920s**: Early jazz, stride piano, New Orleans style
- **1930-1945**: Swing Era / Big Band Era (peak: 1935-1946)
- **1940-1955**: Bebop emergence and development
- **Lindy Hop Dance Era**: 1928-1950s (originated at Savoy Ballroom, Harlem)

## Characteristics of Swing Music

### Tempo & Feel
- **Dance-oriented**: Designed for partner dancing (Lindy Hop, Jitterbug)
- **Typical Lindy Hop tempos**: 110-190 BPM
  - Slow: 110-130 BPM
  - Medium (sweet spot): 130-160 BPM
  - Fast: 160-190 BPM
  - Balboa range: 140-270 BPM
- **4/4 time signature** with emphasis on beats 2 and 4 (backbeat)

### The "Swing Feel"
- Lilting, "swinging" eighth notes (not straight eighths)
- Syncopation and accents
- Walking bass line foundation
- Strong rhythmic pulse that "reaches out to dancers"
