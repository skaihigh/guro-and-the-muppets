# Saxophone for Swing Jazz - Transposition & Melodic Approaches

## Saxophone Transposition

Saxophones are **transposing instruments** - the written note differs from the sounding pitch.

### Transposition Chart

| Saxophone | Key | Written C Sounds As | To Transpose FROM Concert: |
|-----------|-----|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Soprano | Bb | Bb (concert) | Write UP a whole tone (Major 2nd) |
| Alto | Eb | Eb (concert) | Write UP a Major 6th |
| Tenor | Bb | Bb (one octave lower) | Write UP a Major 9th |
| Baritone | Eb | Eb (one octave lower) | Write UP a Major 13th |

### Quick Transposition Reference

#### For Alto Saxophone (Eb)
| Concert Pitch | Alto Written |
|---------------|--------------|
| C | A |
| D | B |
| Eb | C |
| E | C# |
| F | D |
| G | E |
| A | F# |
| Bb | G |
| B | G# |

#### For Tenor Saxophone (Bb)
| Concert Pitch | Tenor Written |
|---------------|---------------|
| C | D |
| D | E |
| Eb | F |
| E | F# |
| F | G |
| G | A |
| A | B |
| Bb | C |
| B | C# |

### Practical Transposition Tips

**Alto (Eb)**: Add 3 sharps (or remove 3 flats) and write a 6th higher
- Concert C major = Alto A major
- Concert G major = Alto E major
- Concert F major = Alto D major

**Tenor (Bb)**: Add 2 sharps (or remove 2 flats) and write a 2nd higher (+ octave)
- Concert C major = Tenor D major
- Concert Bb major = Tenor C major
- Concert F major = Tenor G major

## Swing Era Saxophone Styles

### Two Primary Approaches

#### 1. Coleman Hawkins Style (Vertical/Harmonic)
- Arpeggiate chord tones
- Strong emphasis on harmony
- Full, warm tone with vibrato
- "Body and Soul" (1939) - landmark recording

#### 2. Lester Young Style (Horizontal/Linear)
- Melodic, flowing lines
- Weaves in and out of chord structure
- Lighter, smoother tone
- Less vibrato, fitted to the passage
- Major influence on Charlie Parker and modern jazz

## Melodic Techniques for Swing

### Chord Tone Emphasis
Build melodies around:
1. **Root** - stability
2. **3rd** - defines major/minor quality
3. **5th** - support
4. **7th** - jazz color

### Guide Tones
Focus on **3rds and 7ths** - they define the chord and create smooth voice leading:
```
Dm7:    F (3rd) and C (7th)
G7:     B (3rd) and F (7th)
Cmaj7:  E (3rd) and B (7th)
```

### Approach Patterns

#### Enclosure
Surround target note from above and below:
```
Target: G
Approach: A - F# - G (above, below, target)
```

#### Chromatic Approach
Lead into chord tones chromatically:
```
Target: E (3rd of Cmaj7)
Approach: D# - E or F - E
```

### Swing Phrasing

1. **Swung Eighth Notes**: Long-short feel (triplet-based)
2. **Start Phrases Off-Beat**: Begin on "&" rather than downbeat
3. **Use Space**: Don't fill every beat
4. **Call and Response**: Short phrase, pause, answer

## Scales for Swing Improvisation

### Essential Scales

| Chord | Primary Scale | Notes in C |
|-------|---------------|------------|
| Cmaj7 | C Major (Ionian) | C D E F G A B |
| Cm7 | C Dorian | C D Eb F G A Bb |
| C7 | C Mixolydian | C D E F G A Bb |
| Cm7b5 | C Locrian | C Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb |
| Cdim7 | C Diminished (W-H) | C D Eb F Gb Ab A B |

### Blues Scale (Universal Application)
```
C Blues: C - Eb - F - F#/Gb - G - Bb - C
```
Use over blues progressions and dominant chords for "bluesy" flavor.

### Pentatonic Scales
**Major Pentatonic** (C): C - D - E - G - A
**Minor Pentatonic** (C): C - Eb - F - G - Bb

## Articulation in Swing

### Tonguing Patterns
- **Doo-Dat, Doo-Dat**: Classic swing articulation
- Tongue on beat, slur off-beat
- Soft attack, not harsh

### Vibrato
- **Wide and warm** for ballads (Hawkins style)
- **Subtle or none** for up-tempo (Young style)
- Add at end of sustained notes

### Dynamics
- **Crescendo** through phrases
- **Accent beats 2 and 4** to support swing feel
- **Ghost notes**: Very soft notes for rhythmic interest

## Melodic Ideas for Solos

### Lick Vocabulary
Build a vocabulary of short melodic phrases:

1. **Major 7th arpeggio**: C - E - G - B
2. **1-2-3-5 pattern**: C - D - E - G
3. **Bebop scale run**: C - D - E - F - G - Ab - A - B - C
4. **Blues fragment**: G - Bb - C - C# - D

### Developing Motifs
1. State a simple idea (2-4 notes)
2. Repeat at different pitch level
3. Vary rhythm
4. Expand or contract

## Song Transformation Approach

When adapting a non-jazz song:

1. **Identify the melody** in concert pitch
2. **Transpose for your saxophone**
3. **Simplify if needed** - focus on key melodic notes
4. **Add swing phrasing** - delay notes, add grace notes
5. **Embellish** with approach notes and passing tones
6. **Create fills** between phrases using scales/arpeggios

## Practice Routine Suggestions

1. **Long Tones**: 10 minutes - tone quality and breath control
2. **Scales**: All 12 keys, in swing rhythm
3. **Arpeggios**: Maj7, m7, dom7 through all keys
4. **Transcription**: Learn classic swing solos by ear
5. **Play-Along**: Practice with swing backing tracks
