# Contrabass / Upright Bass - Walking Bass Lines for Swing Jazz

## Role in Swing Era

The double bass became a staple of the jazz rhythm section in the 1920s-30s, providing:
1. **Harmonic foundation** - outlining chord roots and changes
2. **Rhythmic pulse** - steady quarter notes driving the band
3. **Melodic interest** - connecting chord tones smoothly

### Key Historical Figures
- **Wellman Braud** (Duke Ellington) - early visibility, slapping technique
- **Jimmy Blanton** (Duke Ellington, 1939-41) - revolutionized bass as melodic voice
- **Walter Page** (Count Basie) - master of walking lines
- **Milt Hinton** - "Dean of Jazz Bass"

## Walking Bass Line Fundamentals

### What is a "Walking" Bass Line?
A continuous stream of quarter notes that:
- Outlines the chord progression
- Creates forward momentum ("swing")
- Provides harmonic and rhythmic foundation
- Sounds like "walking" - steady, connected movement

### The Primary Rule
**GROOVE FIRST, NOTES SECOND**
- Focus on time and feel before harmonic choices
- Big, fully connected quarter notes
- Minimal space between notes

## Basic Walking Bass Patterns

### Beat Placement Principles
- **Beats 1 & 3**: Chord tones (root, 3rd, 5th) - "strong beats"
- **Beats 2 & 4**: Passing tones, approach notes - "weak beats"

### Root-Based Approach (Beginner)
For any chord, start with:
```
Beat 1: Root
Beat 2: Passing tone
Beat 3: 5th (or root)
Beat 4: Approach note to next chord
```

### Approach Notes (Chromatic & Diatonic)
Leading into the next chord root:
- **Chromatic below**: Half step below target
- **Chromatic above**: Half step above target
- **Diatonic**: Scale tone approach
- **Double chromatic**: Two half steps

### Essential Patterns for ii-V-I

#### Pattern 1: Root-3rd-5th-Approach
```
Dm7:     D - F - A - Ab (chromatic approach to G)
G7:      G - B - D - C# (chromatic approach to C)
Cmaj7:   C - E - G - (next chord approach)
```

#### Pattern 2: Root-5th-3rd-Approach
```
Dm7:     D - A - F - F# (chromatic approach)
G7:      G - D - B - B (leading tone to C)
Cmaj7:   C - G - E - (continue)
```

#### Pattern 3: Descending
```
Dm7:     D - C - B - A
G7:      G - F - E - D#
Cmaj7:   C - B - A - G
```

## Chord Movement Patterns

### Movement by 4th (Most Common)
When chord moves up a 4th (e.g., Cm7 to F7):
```
Ascending: C - D - Eb - E (to F)
or:        C - D - E - E (to F)
```

### Movement by 5th
When chord moves down a 5th:
```
Descending: G - F - E - Eb (to D)
```

### Static Chord (One chord for 2+ bars)
Create melodic interest:
```
Bar 1: Root - 3rd - 5th - 6th
Bar 2: Root - 2nd - 3rd - approach
```

## Swing Feel Tips

### Articulation
- **Legato**: Notes connected, no gaps
- **Slight accent on 2 & 4**: Supports backbeat
- **Consistent volume**: Steady pulse

### Time Feel
- Slightly behind the beat = "laid back" (swing feel)
- Right on the beat = solid foundation
- Avoid rushing (common amateur mistake)

### Physical Technique (Acoustic Bass)
- Strong pizzicato with 1-2 fingers
- Pull string sideways, not up
- Let notes ring fully
- Optional: slapping technique for emphasis

 C E G Bb   C D E F#   G F E Eb   D C B Bb

|F7        |F7        |C7        |C7        |
 F A C Eb   F Eb D C   C E G A    Bb A G F#

|G7        |F7        |C7        |G7        |
 G B D F    F A C Eb   C E G A    G F E D
```

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Root Movement
Play only roots in quarter notes through a tune's changes.

### Exercise 2: Root-5th Pattern
Alternate root and 5th for each chord.

### Exercise 3: Scale-Based Walking
Use chord scales to create stepwise motion.

### Exercise 4: Approach Notes
Focus on smooth voice leading into chord changes.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Playing too loud** - bass should support, not dominate
2. **Inconsistent time** - use metronome practice
3. **Ignoring the drummer** - lock with hi-hat on 2 & 4
4. **Too many notes** - keep it simple and groovy
5. **Random note choices** - outline the harmony clearly

## Song-Specific Application

For any song:
1. Identify the chord progression
2. Map out root movement
3. Add 5ths and 3rds on strong beats
4. Connect with chromatic/diatonic approach notes
5. Practice at slow tempo (60-80 BPM)
6. Gradually increase to performance tempo
