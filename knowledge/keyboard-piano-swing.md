# Keyboard/Piano for Swing Jazz

## Historical Context

### Evolution of Jazz Piano Styles
| Era | Style | Left Hand | Right Hand |
|-----|-------|-----------|------------|
| 1900-1920s | Ragtime | "Oom-pah" bass | Composed melodies |
| 1920-1940s | Stride | Leaping bass-chord | Improvised lines |
| 1930-1945 | Swing/Big Band | Stride or comping | Chords, arpeggios |
| 1940s+ | Bebop/Modern | Comping chords | Horn-like lines |

### Key Swing Era Pianists
- **Count Basie** - sparse, minimalist comping
- **Duke Ellington** - orchestral, rich voicings
- **Art Tatum** - virtuosic stride
- **Teddy Wilson** - elegant, fluid style
- **Earl Hines** - "trumpet style" right hand
- **Mary Lou Williams** - swing to bebop bridge

## Swing Era Piano Techniques

### 1. Stride Piano (Solo Playing)

The left hand "strides" between bass notes and chords:
```
Beat 1: Bass note (low)
Beat 2: Chord (mid-range)
Beat 3: Bass note (could be 5th or octave)
Beat 4: Chord (mid-range)
```

#### Basic Stride Pattern (C major)
```
Left Hand:
Beat 1: C (bass, low)
Beat 2: E-G-C (chord, mid)
Beat 3: G (bass, low)
Beat 4: E-G-C (chord, mid)

Right Hand: Melody, fills, arpeggios
```

#### Stride Tips
- Bass notes on 1 & 3 provide root/5th movement
- Chords on 2 & 4 support rhythm
- Right hand plays melody or improvises
- Requires large hand stretch (practice slowly!)

### 2. Comping (Ensemble Playing)

When playing with a band, the pianist "comps" - providing rhythmic and harmonic support.

#### Count Basie Style: Sparse Comping
- Less is more
- Leave space for other instruments
- Punctuate rather than fill
- "Stab" chords between phrases

#### Comping Rhythms
```
Basic:       | . . . . | . . . . |  (quarter notes)
Swing:       | . - . - | . - . - |  (accent 2 & 4)
Syncopated:  | - . - . | . - - . |  (off-beats)
```

### 3. Left Hand Techniques

#### Shell Voicings (Beginner)
Just root + 7th or root + 3rd:
```
Cmaj7: C + B (root + 7th)
C7:    C + Bb (root + 7th)
Cm7:   C + Bb (root + 7th)
```

#### Tenths (Intermediate)
Root + 10th (compound 3rd):
```
Cmaj7: C (bass) + E (10th above)
Cm7:   C (bass) + Eb (10th above)
```

#### Rootless Voicings (Advanced)
Bass player has the root, so play 3-5-7-9:
```
Cmaj7: E - G - B - D
C7:    E - Bb - D - G (or E - A - Bb - D)
Cm7:   Eb - G - Bb - D
```

## Chord Voicings for Swing

### 7th Chord Voicings (Two-Hand)

#### Major 7th (Cmaj7)
```
LH: C - G
RH: E - B - D (or E - G - B)
```

#### Dominant 7th (C7)
```
LH: C - G
RH: E - Bb - D (or E - G - Bb)
```

#### Minor 7th (Cm7)
```
LH: C - G
RH: Eb - Bb - D (or Eb - G - Bb)
```

### "A" and "B" Voicings (Left Hand)

#### Type A: 3rd on bottom
```
Dm7:  F - A - C - E  (3-5-7-9)
G7:   B - D - F - A  (3-5-7-9)
Cmaj7: E - G - B - D  (3-5-7-9)
```

#### Type B: 7th on bottom
```
Dm7:  C - E - F - A  (7-9-3-5)
G7:   F - A - B - D  (7-9-3-5)
Cmaj7: B - D - E - G  (7-9-3-5)
```

Alternate A and B voicings for smooth voice leading through ii-V-I.

## Scales and Solo Ideas

### Right Hand Solo Techniques

#### Chord-Tone Approach
Base improvisation on chord tones:
```
Cmaj7: C - E - G - B (target these notes)
       Connect with passing tones
```

#### Scale Patterns
```
1-2-3-5 pattern: C - D - E - G (ascending)
                 G - E - D - C (descending)

3-5-7-9 pattern: E - G - B - D
                 (arpeggiating upper structure)
```

#### Blues Licks
Over dominant 7th chords, use blues scale:
```
G blues over G7: G - Bb - C - Db - D - F - G
Add blue notes for authentic swing flavor
```

### Common Solo Devices

1. **Tremolo**: Rapid alternation between notes
2. **Octave Runs**: Right hand plays in octaves
3. **Block Chords**: Melody with chords locked beneath
4. **Arpeggios**: Broken chord patterns
5. **Grace Notes**: Quick notes before main notes

## Patterns for Common Progressions

### ii-V-I Lick (Right Hand)
```
Dm7:       F - A - C - D (ascending)
G7:        F - E - D - B (descending)
Cmaj7:     C (land on root)
```

### Blues Turnaround
```
| C7     | F7     | C7     | C7  G7 |
  C-E-G    F-A-C    E-G-Bb   G-B-D-F
```

### "Rhythm Changes" Bridge
```
| D7     | D7     | G7     | G7     |
| C7     | C7     | F7     | F7     |
```

## Left Hand Comping Patterns

### Pattern 1: Quarter Notes (Basic)
```
|  .  .  .  .  |  (chord on every beat)
```

### Pattern 2: 2 and 4 (Swing Feel)
```
|  -  .  -  .  |  (chord on 2 and 4 only)
```

### Pattern 3: Charleston Rhythm
```
|  .  -  -  .  |  (syncopated)
```

### Pattern 4: Basie "Plunks"
```
|  -  -  .  -  |  (sparse, unpredictable)
```

## Intro, Outro, and Fills

### Common Intro Patterns

#### Count-off Chords
```
| (rest) | (rest) | I  VI | ii  V |
```

#### Stride Intro (2 bars)
```
| I     | V7    | (band enters on I)
```

### Fill Ideas Between Phrases
- Scale runs up to next chord
- Arpeggio of upcoming chord
- Tremolo on chord tones
- Octave jump to melody note

### Endings (Tags)
```
Standard: | ii7   | V7    | I     ||
Fancy:    | ii7   | bII7  | I     ||
Ritard:   | ii7 rit. | V7 | Imaj9  ||
```

## Practice Recommendations

### Daily Routine
1. **Scales**: All major and minor, 2 octaves, in swing rhythm
2. **Arpeggios**: Maj7, m7, dom7 in all 12 keys
3. **ii-V-I**: Practice A and B voicings through all keys
4. **Comping Rhythms**: With metronome at 120-160 BPM
5. **Left Hand Independence**: Stride patterns with metronome

### Transcription Study
Listen to and learn from:
- Count Basie - "One O'Clock Jump"
- Duke Ellington - "C Jam Blues"
- Teddy Wilson - "I Got Rhythm"
- Art Tatum - "Tiger Rag"

## Working with the Band

### Communication with Bass
- Don't duplicate bass notes
- Leave root to bassist
- Use rootless voicings when bass is playing

### Supporting Soloists
- Play softer during solos
- Comp behind the beat slightly
- Leave space for soloist's phrases
- Build energy gradually

### Dynamics
- Verse: Medium soft
- Chorus: Medium
- Solo section: Soft to medium
- Final chorus: Full volume
- Endings: Follow the leader
