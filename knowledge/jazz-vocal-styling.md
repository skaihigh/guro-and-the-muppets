## Core Jazz Vocal Techniques

### 1. Swing Phrasing

#### Behind the Beat
The signature swing vocal feel - slightly late, relaxed:
```
Written:  | One  Two  Three Four |
Sung:     | One   Two   Three  Four |  (slightly delayed)
```

#### Anticipation
Start phrases just before the downbeat:
```
Written:  | (rest) One Two Three |
Sung:     | Oooone Two Three    |  (anticipate beat 1)
```

#### Rubato
Stretching and compressing time expressively:
- Slow down on important words
- Speed through less important syllables
- Return to tempo naturally

### 2. Melodic Interpretation

#### Note Bending
Slide into or away from notes:
- Scoop UP into a note from below
- Fall DOWN from a note at the end
- Adds emotional color

#### Grace Notes
Quick ornamental notes before the main note:
```
Written: "Love"
Sung:    "ah-Love" (quick grace note before)
```

#### Melodic Variation
Change the written melody slightly:
- Add passing tones
- Simplify complex passages
- Vary repeated phrases

### 3. Rhythmic Devices

#### Syncopation
Accent unexpected beats:
```
Normal:    ONE two THREE four
Syncopated: one TWO three FOUR (backbeat emphasis)
           or: one two-AND three four
```

#### Triplet Feel
Group notes in threes for swing:
```
Straight: da-da-da-da
Swing:    da-da-DA, da-da-DA (long-short-LONG)
```

#### Rhythmic Displacement
Shift phrases earlier or later than written:
- Creates tension and release
- Keeps listener engaged

### 4. Scat Singing

#### What is Scat?
Vocal improvisation using nonsense syllables instead of words.

#### Common Scat Syllables
```
Voiced:     doo, ba, bee, bop, dah, dee, dwee
Percussive: dit, dat, bip, bop, skit, skat
Sustained:  ooo, aah, shoo, bah
```

#### Basic Scat Patterns
```
Simple:    doo-bee-doo-bah
Rhythmic:  skit-n-skat-n-doo-wah
Bebop:     doo-dlee-doo-dlee-bop-bah
```

#### Scat Guidelines
1. Base on chord tones (1, 3, 5, 7)
2. Use scale passages to connect
3. Match syllables to rhythm (hard syllables for accents)
4. Listen to Ella Fitzgerald for inspiration
5. Start simple, build complexity

### 5. Vibrato

#### Types
- **Straight tone**: No vibrato (modern, cool)
- **Terminal vibrato**: Add vibrato at end of notes (Billie Holiday)
- **Constant vibrato**: Throughout sustained notes (operatic - avoid)

#### Swing Era Style
- Vibrato used selectively
- Often saved for emotional moments
- Faster, narrower than classical vibrato
- Fitted to the passage

### 6. Dynamics and Expression

#### Dynamic Contrast
- Build through phrases (crescendo)
- Drop to intimate on personal lyrics
- Full voice on climactic moments
- Whisper for emphasis

#### Emotional Coloring
- Joy: Brighter tone, forward placement
- Sadness: Darker tone, breathier
- Longing: Sustained notes, rubato
- Playfulness: Light, bouncy delivery

## Converting a Song to Jazz Vocal Style

### Step 1: Learn the Original
- Know the melody cold
- Understand the lyrics deeply
- Identify emotional peaks

### Step 2: Establish Swing Feel
- Feel the tempo in your body
- Internalize the backbeat (2 and 4)
- Practice counting in swing time

### Step 3: Apply Phrasing Changes
Original: "I love you truly"
Jazz:     "I... love you tru-ly" (delay, stretch "love")

### Step 4: Add Melodic Variations
Original: C - D - E - G
Jazz:     C - C# - D - Eb - E - G (chromatic approach)

### Step 5: Interpret the Lyrics
- Which words are most important?
- Where should you breathe?
- What emotion drives each phrase?

### Step 6: Add Improvisation (Optional)
- Scat intro or outro
- Melodic variations on repeated sections
- Fills between phrases

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Delay Practice
Sing "Happy Birthday" slightly behind the beat while snapping on 2 & 4.

### Exercise 2: Scat Basics
Over a simple ii-V-I:
```
Dm7:    doo-bee-dah (D-F-A)
G7:     doo-wah-bah (G-B-D)
Cmaj7:  doooo      (C)
```

### Exercise 3: Melodic Variation
Take a simple melody. Sing it 4 times, slightly different each time.

### Exercise 4: Emotional Interpretation
Sing one verse happy, one sad, one angry, one longing. Notice how your voice changes.
